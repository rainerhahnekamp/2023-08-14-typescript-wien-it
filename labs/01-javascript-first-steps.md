# TypeScript Workshop - First Steps with JavaScript

1. Study the example shown by the trainer
2. Create a similar example with passengers. Below you will find the required steps.
3. Create a constructor function for `Passenger`. It should have the following parameters: `id`, `firstname`, `lastname`.
4. Create a constructor function with the name `PassengerManager`. It should manage a list of `Passenger` it gets as an array. `PassengerManager` should have the following methods:
   1. `add`: adds a new `Passenger`.
   2. `getById`: get the `Passenger` according to its `id`.
   3. `getByLastname`. get the `Passenger` according to its `lastname`.
   4. `count`: returns the amount of `Passenger`.
